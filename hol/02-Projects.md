# ðŸ”¨ Hands-on: GitHub Projects

In his hands-on lab you will practice working with GitHub projects. The exercise cosists of the following parts:
- [Working with the backlog](#working-with-the-backlog)
- [Working with boards](#working-with-boards)
- [Workflows](#workflows)

## Working with the backlog

1. Go to your GitHub profile | `Projects` and click `Create project`
2. Start with a normal table and give the project a name (i.e., `GitHub Bootcamp`)
3. In this repository, go to `Projects` and add the project you just created
4. Display the hidden `Labels`field
5. Add a new `Single Select` named `Level` with the values `Epic`, `Feature`, `Story`, and `Task`
6. Add a number field `Effort`
7. Add an iteration field `Sprint` with a two week cadence
8. Add an iteration field `Quarter` with a 12 week cadence
9. Add your existing issues with the correct levels and some other sample data
10. Group the backlog by level and safe the view.

2. Transition some issues and see how the status changes.

## Summary 

In his hands-on lab you have practiced working with GitHub projects.

Now that you have finished this exercise, you can continue and learn to [collaborate on code](../README.md#part-3--collaborate-on-code).
